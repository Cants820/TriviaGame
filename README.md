#Player must click the correct answer to win

#Player must press game start to play the game
#Once press, game loads with a series of questions
#To select the answer player must click the radio box with the correct answer.
#After 30 secs answers are going to be tally as correct, wrong, and unanswered.

#I was able to dynamic generate questions from an object. To capture the radio butons, I was able to create a psuedo-selector to capture radio buttons values. Then I compared radio button value to my answer key coming from my object. I was unable compare both values but unable to tally wrongs and rights. For some reason every radio button clicked would give 10 or increments on both wrong and right buttons.
#I also had issues with my timer. It would go past 0 and continue to decrement.
